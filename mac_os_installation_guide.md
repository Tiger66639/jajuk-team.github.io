# Mac OS Installation Guide

## Targeted platforms

This documentation targets MAC OS X and above. Jajuk is available only for Intel 64 bits Mac (10.4, 10.5, 10.6 and above).

If you get the **"Jajuk can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."** message, see the [FAQ](/jajuk_faq.html).

**Mac OS X on PowerPC (10.4 and older) is NOT supported as it doesn't support Java 6 required by Jajuk.**

## Requirements

- Apple Java Runtime environment (JRE) 1.6 and above. Not sure if you already have Java ? Check this [link](http://javatester.org/version.html).
- 1024x768 screen resolution and higher 

*Note : From Jajuk 1.9, Mplayer (the player used by jajuk to read the music) is included into the mac os installation file, there is no more need to install it separatly)*

## Installation using the ZIP file

It is basically the standard OSX installation process like any other application :

- Open the zip file.
- Drag the Jajuk icon to the "Application" icon.
- Jajuk is installed, launch it from the Finder.
- OSX should warn you that Jajuk has been downloaded form the Internet, it is safe to say "Yes" to run it. 

## Upgrade

If you already have an installed Jajuk release:

- It is safe to install the new release over previous one without uninstalling, Jajuk supports backwards compatibility.
- Jajuk doesn't support downwards compatibility: A Jajuk release may not work with a collection built by a newer release than the one you use. 

## Uninstallation

Just move the Jajuk app to the Trash from the Finder.
