# Windows Installation Guide

## Targeted platforms

This documentation targets: Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, Seven.

## Requirements

- Java Runtime environment (JRE) 1.6 and above. To install it, go to [http://www.java.com/](http://www.java.com/) and click Download. Not sure if you already have Java installed on your computer ? Check this [link](http://javatester.org/version.html).
- 1024x768 screen resolution and higher 

## Installation

We provide a self-extracting Windows archive : **Jajuk-{version}-setup.exe**.

- Download it somewhere on your disk.
- Double click on it.
- "Do you want to allow the following program from an unknown publisher to make changes to this computer?" : Yes (you get this message because we don't pay Microsoft to be a registered publisher, we can't afford it being a free software).
- Follow the installer instructions. 


If you need administrator rights and can't install jajuk, see [this faq entry](/jajuk_faq.html#Need_admin_rights_to_install).

## Run

Launch Jajuk by clicking on Jajuk icon : Start -> Programs -> Jajuk -> Jajuk

## Upgrade

If you already have an installed Jajuk release:

- It is safe to reinstall the new release over a previous one without uninstalling, Jajuk supports backwards compatibility.
- Jajuk doesn't support downwards compatibility : a Jajuk release may not work with a collection built by a newer release than the one you used. 

## Support

If you need help, check out our [FAQ](/jajuk_faq.html) and our [manual](/jajuk_manual.html).

## Uninstallation

- Launch uninstaller by clicking on the menu : Start -> Programs -> Jajuk ->'Uninstall'.
